A Software Company in collaboration with the government seeks to address this through a real-time health monitoring system, aiming to transform healthcare and improve operational efficiency.
Specific Problems:
1. Insecure Communication: Doctors, patients, and chemists lack secure channels to share medical data, leading to data breaches and security risks.

2. Patient Privacy Concerns: Patients worry about medical data misuse, hindering necessary information sharing for care.

3. Inefficiency: The current system's inefficiency causes care delays due to multiple communication steps, frustrating patients.
